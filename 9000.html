description: The purpose of this module is to accept caller id from angel and then hit the database (actually stubbed off and represented by a python dictionary) to see if theyâ€™re a registered user. If not, it assigned them 1111111111 as a number, which is the corresponding id for the demo account in the database. That way, they can demo the application without being registered.
