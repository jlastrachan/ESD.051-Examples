<p>As explained in class, Angel is a wonderful platform for creating voice applications, but
trades of extensibility and flexibility in exchange for ease of use by a non-technical
user. Luckily, it also contains the ability to create transaction pages, which open
up the option to interface with any application, provided you can do so via a URL.</p>

<p>The examples provided include interfacing with Angel to retrieve variables, querying
external APIs to retrieve data, parsing XML to extract the data you're interested in,
and formatting the data so that Angel can understand your response.</p>

You don't need to understand this to make a useful page, and it is complete overkill
unless you're really interested in how it works under the hood. It will be largely
incomprehensible unless you've had extensive XML experience.</p></li>
